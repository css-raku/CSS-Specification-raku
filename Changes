  for example: 'font-family'	[ <generic-family> | <family-name> ]#
  will resolve as a generic-family in preference to a family name

- If a property has edges, there should be exactly four

0.3.0 Distinguish 'edge' and 'child' properties
- A four sided propert has 'edges'. E.g. 'border' has
  'border-top', ... 'border-left'

  'background-attachment', 'background-image', ...
0.2.2 Include subproperties in meta childern.
- E.g. "cue" now has child properties "cue-before", "cue-after"
